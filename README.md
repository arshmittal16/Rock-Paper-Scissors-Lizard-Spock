# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

For all the Big Bang Theory fans out there!
I've coded Dr. Sheldon Cooper's infamous game "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" using Python3. I used the random library to generate a random outcome of the computer the player plays with. The program keeps a tab of both the player and the computer's score, and in the end when the player wishes to stop, it prints the results.
