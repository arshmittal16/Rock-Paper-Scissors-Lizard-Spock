# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

For all the Big Bang Theory fans out there!
I've coded Dr. Sheldon Cooper's infamous game "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" using Python3. I used the random library to generate a random outcome of the computer the player plays with. The program keeps a tab of both the player and the computer's score, and in the end when the player wishes to stop, it prints the results. 
I've included both the py and ipynb files for easy access.

The Rules of the game are as follows:

                     Scissors cuts Paper 

                    Paper covers Rock 

                    Rock crushes Lizard 

                    Lizard poisons Spock 

                    Spock smashes Scissors 

                    Scissors decapitates Lizard 

                    Lizard eats Paper 

                    Paper disproves Spock 

                    Spock vaporizes Rock 

                    (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
